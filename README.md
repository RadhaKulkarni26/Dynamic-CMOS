# Dynamic-CMOS
### Dynamic CMOS basically relies on temporarily storing signals using various load capacitances. Here we have a PMOS circuit connected to the Vdd supply and a clock applied to its gate terminal. Then we have a Pull Down Network made of an NMOS which has k no. of inputs implementing a Boolean equation. Then we have an NMOS circuit connected to the ground and clock signal connected at its gate terminal. Output is taken between the PMOS and Pull-down network. Here we have also connected a load capacitance.
